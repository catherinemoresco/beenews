# beenews
a web application that scrapes google news for the latest news about bees
# FAQ
### Why?
I have a lot of friends who like bees.
### How?
It scrapes the first page of Google News, and slaps the content onto a bee-themed page.
### This seems pointless...
So?
### What do you have planned next for beenews?
Maybe parallax scrolling, maybe some bee particles flying aroung in the background...the sky is the limit, really.
### Thank you for making this. It has enriched my life.
You're welcome. That's why I do what I do.
